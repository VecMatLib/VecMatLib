# VecMatLib

Hexagon VecMatLib provides simple structures for vectors and matrices and an implementation of all their basic operations.

## Design principles

- VecMatLab is lightweight, all operations use the fastest and most simple method.
- Vectors and matrices are immutable. All operations do not alter the object on which they are invoked, they return a new one instead.
- All operations implemented by vectors and matrices are intended to work similarly to java basic operators (examples below).

## Support the project

VecMatLib was developed by a single person.

Initially a university project, later completed and turned into a full project.
